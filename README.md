# Connor Jacobs Portfolio

## Description

Homework assignment 2 was to create a portfolio page from scratch. Using semantic HTML, I structured the layout of my page to have an Image, an About Me section, a Work section, and a Contact section. There are links to each section of the page, as well as a link to a deployed application. Using CSS, I styled each section with a gradient design, and included media querie's to add responsive design.
