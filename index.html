            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>

            <p>My name is Connor Jacobs and I live in Durham, North Carolina. I was born in Upstate New York, but moved to NC at the age of four, so I claim NC as my home. I attended Appalachian State University and received a Bachelor of Science in Healthcare Management in 2014.
            <br>
            <br>
            After graduating from college, I moved back to the Triangle and decided to switch gears and pursue a career in banking. For the past six years, I have worked for First Citizens Bank in a variety of roles. I started as a Bank Teller in a branch and am now a Credit Portfolio Analyst. I spend my days at work evaluating the financial performance of small businesses. While it's not a bad job, it doesnt provide the stimulation I'm seeking in a profession.
            <br>
            <br>
            I began the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at UNC in January, 2021. My goal after the bootcamp is to land a Software Developer position with my current employer and to gain experience and knowledge in that role. After that, I'd like to one day work as a developer for a public entity such as a non-profit, university, or municipal government.
            <br>
            <br>
            On a personal level, I'm a bit of a clown. When I'm not at work or learning to code, you'll find me doing one of the following: playing the drums, cracking jokes with my friends, watching a good movie, eating good food, reading about politics, or watching a game.
